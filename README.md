Project Description: 

Cafeteria Crowd Estimation and Management

The Cafeteria Crowd Estimation and Management project aims to address the challenges faced in corporate offices where the cafeteria experiences high footfall on a daily basis. The project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect individuals entering and exiting the cafeteria, enabling an accurate estimation of the number of people present inside.
The system consists of a device positioned at the entry and exit points of the cafeteria, equipped with computer vision capabilities. This device captures and processes real-time video or image data to identify individuals entering and exiting the cafeteria premises. By analyzing the number of entries and exits, the system calculates and maintains an estimate of the current crowd density within the cafeteria.
All the collected data, including entry and exit counts, are securely stored in the cloud infrastructure. This allows for easy access, retrieval, and analysis of the crowd estimation information. The authorities responsible for managing the cafeteria are provided with a dedicated mobile application that interfaces with the cloud-based data.
The mobile application offers the cafeteria authorities a convenient and user-friendly interface to monitor the crowd estimation in real-time. With this information at their disposal, the authorities can effectively plan and manage the food preparation process, ensuring that an adequate quantity of food is available to meet the demand of the crowd present in the cafeteria.


Key Features:
          1. Computer vision-based system to detect and count individuals entering and exiting the cafeteria.
          2. Real-time estimation of the crowd density within the cafeteria.
          3. Cloud-based storage for securely storing the crowd estimation data.
          4. Mobile application for cafeteria authorities to access real-time crowd estimation information.
          5. Efficient food preparation planning based on accurate crowd estimation.
By implementing the Cafeteria Crowd Estimation and Management project, corporate offices can optimize their cafeteria operations, prevent food shortages during peak hours, and enhance the overall dining experience for their employees or visitors.
